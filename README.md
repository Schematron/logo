# Schematroll, the Schematron mascot

Schematroll, the Schematron mascot, was drawn by Cody Chang and is free for use on Schematron-related products. The mascot is a cross between the marsupials the Bilby and the Bettong. North and West Hemisphere people sometimes think it is some kind of rabbit or donkey, due to the reluctance of these excellent creatures to appear in television programs.
